This is the source code for my website

# colors used
Don't know where to put this so might as well just write it here

- default (almost used by everything): #97f9cc
- page header: #14b8a6
- sub headers: #34d399
- links: #f97316
- links (on hover): #14b8a6
- background: #0b1220
- page background: #15213c

To make things look dark, with a general "blue" vibe. To make the links appear more unique, I used orange (complement color of blue) to make them more unique.
